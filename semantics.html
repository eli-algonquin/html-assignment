<h1>Welcome to my site! </h1>
<h2> <em>About me</em></h2> 
	<p>My name is Eli (short for Elijah) I am a big fan of design and very interested in videoography. I quite enjoy creating 		things, anything....whatever that may be! Sometime in the future I hope to do some sort of work in the design field, I just really like making things simply put, since a young age i've always been a huge fan of creating whether that was <strong>costumes, clay figures</strong> or very <strong>rudamentary stop motion</strong></p>	
    	
        	<p>I'm quite the ethusiast when it comes to design, I enjoy spending my freetime writing, reading watching films, and making videos of my own. If not that then you can often find me with my nose deep in some online comics because god knows I'm not paying nearly 5 bucks for an issue of Spider-Man. Anyways, I hope you find this site design nice! even if it may be a bit simple! With my very awesome html powers let me show you <strong><em>the power</em></strong></p>

      	<p> I believe someone once said... :</p>
        	<p> "Every window on Alcatraz has a view of San Francisco."</p>

         <p> That is one quote from Girl, Interrupted. Over the weekend I had began watching the film and enjoyed it very much, I miss the human element of film making as odd as it feels to say.</p>
